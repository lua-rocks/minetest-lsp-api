# Notes

## Rules

In my opinion, in its current form, the documentation is very awkward and
chaotic. The same thing is quite often described in three to ten different
places, scattered throughout the file, the length of 10k+ lines.

For this reason, I decided to keep this rule: every time I encounter a new
definition, I search for it throughout the file and move all mentions of it up,
closer to where it was first announced. This way I get rid of the various "see
here, see there" which are completely irrelevant in LSP-annotations.

Also, I try to start all sentences in all comments with a capital letter and end
with a period.

Otherwise, I try not to make huge edits to the documentation, so that all the
changes from the original .txt file is easy to update in .lua file.
