# Notes

## Rules

- In my opinion, in its current form, the documentation is very fragmented. For
  this reason, I decided to keep this rule: every time I encounter a new
  definition, I search for it throughout the file and move all mentions of it
  up, closer to where it was first announced. This way I get rid of the various
  "see here, see there" which are completely irrelevant in LSP-annotations.
- All sentences in all comments ideally must be started with a capital letter
  and ended with a period.
- Don't make huge edits in the documentation, so that all the changes from the
  original .txt file is easy to update in .lua file.
- Don't use the `definition` word in the class/alias names -- they are
  definitions by default.
