# Minetest Game LSP API

The [LSP API] not only makes development much more pleasant but also helps to
detect serious bugs, so I hope that when everything is ready, it will become the
standard for Minetest devs and modders.

## Goals

- [ ] Transfer here all the docs from [Minetest] in [LSP format]
- [ ] Fork [Minetest Game] and solve all problems found using this API
- [ ] Fork [MineClone2] and do the same
- [ ] Ask Minetest and MineClone2 devs about PR
